December 21st, 2024 -- Project paused. Please don't expect new features or bug fixes. TOC updates may or may not come, the addon should work simply by checking "Load Outdated Addons" within the game client. 
If you have a feature or bug fix, please fork the project and submit a pull request and I'll review it.
